  // both panels. The ceiling is a request, not a promise: getTexture()
  // saturates at the achievable depth.
  //
  // MIN IS 1, NOT 0. getTexture() does Math.max(1, framesAgo), so 0 and 1 are
  // the same frame — a 0-based range would alias its bottom two steps and make
  // "R 0, G 1, B 2" sample only TWO distinct frames while looking like three.
  // That reads as "the effect barely works", not as an off-by-one, which is
  // exactly how it was found: a 0/1/2 test came back grey because R and G were
  // identical by construction.
  //
  // Defaults are a visible spread (1 / 5 / 9 frames ≈ 0 / 67 / 133 ms at 60fps)
  // rather than a neutral 1/1/1. This is a NEW source, not a parameter carved
  // out of an existing constant, so there is no prior picture to reproduce —

  //
  // There is deliberately no threshold and no softness here. The keyer already

  // frame-to-frame difference is a few percent and would otherwise sit at the
  // very bottom of the keyer's range.
  //
  // ONE THING TO KNOW when routing this to the keyer: the keyer passes a BAND —
  // `alpha = smoothstep(black..) * (1 - smoothstep(white..))` — so it rejects
  // the very bright as well as the very dark. At the default KeyLevelWhite of
  // 80% a fully lit matte is keyed OUT, which looks like the brightest motion
  // being the only thing that fails to show. Set KeyLevelWhite to 100% and let

  //
  // The client side of §4.1's split. These params describe the engine; they
  // never travel to it — `src/audio/AudioBinding.js` translates each one into a
  // §8.8 address locally, so no ImWeb identifier crosses the boundary (rule 3).
  //
  // GROUPS, and why they differ (§4.8 capture is opt-out — every param whose
  // group is not 'global' IS captured by a Display State):
  //
  //   'global'  — anything that ALLOCATES, OPENS A DEVICE, or RELAYOUTS.
  //               `audio.tapeSec` reallocates the tape, which throws away every
  //               recording in it; `audio.mic` opens a permissioned device;
  //               partition bounds are a setup act that §4.3 fixes at session
  //               start. Capturing any of them means recalling a Display State
  //               mid-set destroys material or reopens hardware — the loudest
  //               possible version of the silent-reload failure §4.8 exists to
  //               prevent.
  //   'arec' /  — performance state. Region, rate, on/off ARE captured: they
  //   'aplay'     are what a Display State is for, and every index here points
  //   'audio'     into a FIXED slot table (8 partitions, 128 zones per type),
  //               so unlike glsl.preset it cannot drift under a saved state.
  //
  // Regions are fractions of their partition, not sample counts, for the same
  // reason §4.3 makes zone positions partition-relative: a captured layout has
  // to mean the same thing on a machine whose tape is a different length.
  // A TOGGLE, not a TRIGGER: a trigger can only ever start, so there was no way
  // to release the audio device short of a reload. Still 'global' — a Display
  // State must not be able to seize or drop the sound card.

   * one path to the address instead of two racing ones — and the pad's
   * position becomes visible in the UI and captured by a Display State.
