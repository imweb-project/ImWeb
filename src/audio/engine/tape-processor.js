     * as one length. For a dynamic recording it is worse still: the seam it runs
     * to is derived from the partition, so this would move the finish line
     * mid-capture.

     * **Deferring until the zone stops would keep the lie, just shorter** — the
     * UI showing P3 while the take lands in P0 is exactly the property that made

     * `_alloc` clears `pend` outright, so a parked change can be dropped rather
     * than delayed.
     *
     * So it is refused, which is the house rule for a message the engine cannot
     * honour as the client means it — the same rule as `_refuseRenderZone`, the
