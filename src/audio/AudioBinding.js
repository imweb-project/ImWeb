/**
 * ParameterSystem ⇄ AudioEngine. The only place the two halves touch.
 *
 * §4.1's test is *could you delete every line of ImWeb UI and still drive a
 * working sound engine from a script?* This file is the answer's edge: it is
 * the ONLY module that imports both `ps` and the engine, and everything below
 * it — `AudioEngine`, `protocol.js`, the worklet — stays ImWeb-free. Adding an
 * `import { ... } from '../controls/...'` to any of those makes the boundary
 * fake; `tests/audit-audio-protocol.mjs` fails if one appears.
 *
 * §8.8 rule 3 says no ImWeb identifier crosses the boundary, and the mechanism
 * here is translation, not transport: `aplay.rate` is turned into
 * `/zone/play/0/rate` locally and the string `aplay.rate` never leaves this
 * file. (The opaque-slot table rule 3 also describes belongs with worklet-side
 * controller evaluation — §8.7 — which does not exist yet. Nothing here needs
 * it, and pretending otherwise would be a slot allocator with one caller.)
 *
 * Unit translation lives here too, deliberately. Params are fractions of a
 * partition (§4.3 — a captured layout must mean the same thing on a machine
 * whose tape is a different length); the engine wants samples. One conversion
 * site, not one per call.
