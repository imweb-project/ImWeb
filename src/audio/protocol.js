/**
 * The audio protocol — §8.8 of docs/ImWeb-Audio-Blueprint.md.
 *
 * This file is the ONE place addresses and their argument types are authored.
 * The worklet (src/audio/engine/tape-processor.js) cannot import it: an
 * AudioWorklet global scope has no module loader, so the processor must be a
 * single self-contained file. That is a real constraint, and the honest answer
 * to it is a fixpoint check, not a second copy — `tests/audit-audio-protocol.mjs`
 * asserts that every address handled by the worklet is declared here and every
 * implemented address declared here is handled by the worklet. Six drifting
 * copies of SOURCE_DEFS is the precedent being avoided (CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * **This file must have zero ImWeb imports and must never import one.** It is
 * part of the engine contract, and §4.1's test is: could you delete every line
 * of ImWeb UI and still drive the engine from a script?
 *
 * Rule 1 (§8.8): every message must be representable as OSC 1.0 — addresses are
 * OSC-legal paths, arguments are `i` `f` `s` `b` `T` `F` and nothing else.
 * `encode()` enforces that at the send site rather than trusting the caller, so
 * a message that could not survive a UDP hop cannot be constructed at all.

// 2 since step 7: the controller vocabulary arrived (§8.7) and
// `/ctrl/<n>/range` gained an argument. A signature that changes without a
// bump is precisely the half-understood protocol `/engine/hello` exists to
// refuse — the handshake can only protect what the number tracks.
//
// 3 since step 8: the spectral writer (§4.5) brought the image slots, the
// render verb and the job replies. New addresses count as much as changed
// signatures here — an engine one version behind answers `/spec/0/data` with
// `unknown address`, and a client that never learns that will sit waiting on a
// `/job/<n>/done` nothing is going to send.
//
// 4 since step 9: the corpus index (§4.6) brought `/corpus/analyse`, its reply,
// and the grain player's zone type. A new ZONE TYPE is the sharper reason —
// `grain` joining ZONE_TYPES changes how `normalizeAddress` collapses an
// address, so an older client and a newer engine disagree about what
// `/zone/grain/0/on` even IS rather than merely one of them not knowing it.
// 5 since step 12: the spectral writer's PAN image (§8.14). A new address, so
// the step-8 reason applies unchanged and needs no embellishment.
//
// An earlier version of this comment invented a second reason — that an older
// engine would DROP a pan image silently and render mono — and it was wrong
// twice: `/engine/hello` refuses a version mismatch outright, and an unrecognised
// address is refused loudly as `unknown address` even if one ever got past it.
// Nothing here fails quietly across versions.
//
// What IS new, and lives inside one version rather than between two: this is the
// first OPTIONAL upload. A render with no pan image and a render whose pan image
// was refused sound identical, because both are mono — so the refusal has to be
// visible somewhere the performer looks, which is what the status line is for.
//
// 6 adds `/tape/read`: the raw samples back out, so a recording can outlive
// Audio Off and travel in a project file. Same step-8 reason for the bump.
