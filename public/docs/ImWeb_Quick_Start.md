# ImWeb Quick-Start: From Zero to Real-Time Performance

> Browser-based live video synthesis ecosystem · v0.28.0

Welcome to **ImWeb**. Think of this interface as a digital video instrument:
every slider can be performed live, automated, or mapped to your surroundings.

Here is how to get your first reactive patch running in under two minutes.

## 🛠️ Step 1: Learn the Safety Net & Immediate Presets

Before you tweak anything, locate your two biggest anchor points.

**The Thumbnail States (bottom bar).** The row of thumbnails across the very
bottom is the **State grid** — 32 tiles in two rows of 16. On first launch it is
seeded from the factory project, so several tiles already hold complete,
pre-configured visual ecosystems. Click a tile that **has a thumbnail** to
recall it instantly and see what the software can do.

> Clicking an **empty** (dark) tile does nothing. To keep a look you like,
> press **Shift+S** (saves into the next empty slot) or right-click a tile →
> **Save here**.

The leftmost **○** tile is the **Neutral State** (keyboard: **⌘⇧0** /
**Ctrl+Shift+0**): it resets every parameter value without touching your
controller assignments.

**The Panic Button (toolbar, top right).** If the screen goes entirely crazy or
breaks into extreme feedback, press the **↺** button in the toolbar at the right
end of the top status bar — or just hit **Shift+Esc**. After an *OK* to confirm,
it resets all parameters to their defaults **and clears every controller
assignment**, routes all three layers back to Camera, and closes any open
workspace — which strips the heavy processing away and leaves your raw, clean
camera input on screen.

Two gentler versions of the same escape, when you want your settings kept:

| Escape | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **All FX** toggle (Effects tab) | Bypasses the entire post-FX chain. Every parameter keeps its value, so switching back on returns exactly the look you left |
| **S** | Solo — bypass effects and look at the raw composite |
| **H** | Fade to black (toggle) — the safest thing to press in front of an audience |

## 🎭 Step 2: Play with the 3 Layers

ImWeb composites three core video paths. They live in the right-hand control
panel, under the **Mix** tab ▸ **LAYERS**. You can cycle through the available
sources for each one using fast hotkeys, without touching the panel at all:

- Press **Q** to change the **Foreground** layer.
- Press **A** to change the **Background** layer.
- Press **Z** to change the **DisplaceSrc** (Displacement Source) layer.

Each press steps to the next source in exactly the order the LAYERS dropdowns
list them (Live In → Media → Generators → From the Signal → Mix), so the
keyboard and the menu always agree.

> **Panel orientation.** The control panel has six tabs:
> **Sources · Mix · Effects · Output · Audio · Project**. The first four follow
> the signal — where a picture comes from, how pictures are combined, what is
> done to them, where they go. **Audio** is the sound half of the instrument
> (tape, zones, spectral writer, grains, voice), and **Project** is for saving
> it all. The larger editors — **3D Scene**, **Analog TV**, **Draw** and
> **Shader Code (GLSL)** — are *workspaces*: click **⤢ Open workspace** on their
> row in Sources (Shader Code also from Effects) and they open as an extra tab
> with a **✕** to close it.

## 🌀 Step 3: Trigger a Real-Time Warp (Displacement)

Let's manually test one of the most powerful features in the app:

1. In the right-hand panel, go to the **Mix** tab and find the **Displacement**
   section. Click the header to expand it.
   *(Tip: click the small **⊞** icon at the right of any section header to detach
   it into its own floating, resizable window.)*
2. By default, **Displace** is set to `0.0`. Grab that slider and drag it up
   towards `100`. You will immediately see your pixels twist and shift, driven
   by whatever source the DisplaceSrc layer is set to.

Displacement reads the *brightness* of the DS layer as a push direction, so what
you route to DS with **Z** changes the character of the warp completely — try
Noise, then try Camera.

## 🎛️ Step 4: The Fundamental Trick (Automate with Right-Click)

Instead of moving sliders manually, you can make the system modulate itself:

1. **Right-click** (or **Ctrl-click**) directly on the **DisplOffset** row —
   the label, the value, anywhere in the row.
2. A long popup list of input controllers appears: **Mouse X / Mouse Y**,
   **Sound Level / Bass / Mid / High**, **MIDI CC…** and **MIDI Note…** (with
   MIDI learn if a controller is plugged in), **Tilt** and **Compass** on a
   tablet, gamepad axes, pen pressure, **Random**, **Expression…**, and the LFOs.
3. Select **LFO Sine**. A prompt asks for the LFO rate, pre-filled with `0.5` —
   press OK and leave it there for now.
4. Look at the row: between the label and the value there is now a small
   highlighted **badge** reading **`LFO~`**. That badge is the controller.
   (Every controller type gets its own badge — `RND`, `MX`, `SND`, `CC7`…)
5. **Right-click** (or **Ctrl-click**) directly on that badge. A secondary popover
   opens where you can fine-tune the LFO's shape, frequency, phase and slew, and
   set the min/max range it sweeps — so the distortion pulses smoothly on its own.

> **Beat-sync.** At the rate prompt you can type `1b` instead of a number to lock
> the LFO to one beat of the global BPM — `2b` for two beats, `0.5b` for half.
> Tap **T** to set the tempo by ear.

Any parameter in ImWeb accepts any controller. That is the whole instrument in
one sentence.

## 📂 Step 5: Drop in Your Own Materials

ImWeb is an open canvas for your own media. **Drag files from your desktop and
drop them anywhere on the video canvas:**

| You drop | What happens |
|----------|--------------|
| `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv` | Loads into **Movie Deck A** and starts playing; FG switches to it. **⇧-drop** routes it to **Deck B** instead |
| `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp` | Loads as a still image source |
| `.glb`, `.gltf`, `.obj`, `.stl`, `.dae` | Loads into the 3D scene, which activates itself |
| `.imx` | An ImWeb effect-chain export |

Project files are *not* canvas drops — load `.imweb` with **Cmd+O**, and
`.imbank` / `.imstate` from the Project tab and the state-tile right-click menu.

Your imported videos are listed in the **Movie Library** (Sources tab ▸ Media) —
every movie you have, with thumbnails and a filter box. Drag a row onto a deck,
or use its `→A` / `→B` buttons, to assign it. `Shift+1–8` selects clips on Deck A,
`Option+1–8` on Deck B (`Shift+0` / `Option+0` also pick clip 1).

> Don't confuse the Movie Library with the **Clip Library** below it — that one
> holds short clips you *record* out of ImWeb's own live output.

## Notes for teaching with this

This structure works well in an education environment because of its order. It
hands students a safety net first (Step 1), gives them physical keyboard
interaction next (Step 2), and only then reveals the hidden depth of the
software's modulation engine (Steps 3 and 4) — without requiring them to write
a line of code.

The single idea worth landing before anything else: **a slider is not a setting,
it is a destination.** Once someone has right-clicked one parameter and watched
it move on its own, every other parameter in the instrument has been explained.

## Where to go next

- **[Quick Reference](ImWeb_Quick_Reference.md)** — every source, effect and
  shortcut on a few pages.
- **[Full Manual](ImWeb_Full_Manual.md)** — the complete parameter reference.
- Press **?** in the app for the keyboard shortcut overlay, and **⌘K** (Ctrl+K)
  or **/** to search for any parameter by name — ⌘K works on every keyboard
  layout, `/` only where it is a single key (US layout).
