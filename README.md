## What This Is

Image/ine was a rare instrument. Created at STEIM Amsterdam in the 1990s by Tom Demeyer in close collaboration with Steina Vasulka — one of the founders of video art — it treated video as a malleable, real-time medium for artistic performance. It ran on Mac OS 9 (1997) and later OS X (2008). No equivalent free tool has existed since.

ImWeb is a ground-up reimagining for the modern browser — an instrument rooted in the original's philosophy, extending a signal path that has always pointed toward what comes next.

**Built with** Three.js, Vite, and raw WebGL shaders — no framework dependencies, nothing between the artist and the signal.

**Signal path:**

```

```

## Quick Start

**Requires Node 18+**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# → open http://localhost:5173
```

Chrome 113+ recommended for best WebGL performance.
Firefox and Safari supported in WebGL mode with minor limitations.

## Features (v0.23.0)

### Input Sources

- Camera (WebRTC, auto-start on load)
- Movie Library — unlimited catalogue of clips with thumbnail, duration and filter box; auto-loaded from `_imweb_ready/` on startup; drag a row onto a deck or use `→A` / `→B`
- Movie decks A and B — two independent engines, 8 loaded clips each; speed (±3×), loop range, position scrub, BPM sync, mirror, mute; a full rack evicts its oldest clip, never the one playing
- Mix buses ×3 — Mix 1/2/3, each crossfading or combining any two sources (Add, Multiply, Luma Mask, Displace); the mixed signal is itself a source, so it can be composited, captured and time-displaced
- Analog TV — Phase 1 signal simulator (720×480); 4:3 cropping; hue/sat/bright/contrast grading
- Stills buffer — capture up to 64 frames (8×8 grid), FrameSelect 1/2/3
- Color source (HSV solid)
- Noise source (pixel)
- 3D scene — all geometry, transforms, material, camera; GLTF/GLB/OBJ/STL import; auto-spin; Cloner (MoGraph InstancedMesh) with Twist/Scatter/Wave/ScaleStep effectors; Blob/Morph vertex displacement; N-D Hypercube engine (4D–12D) with edge/face/instancer rendering; real-time pipeline texture on instancer geometry
- Slit scan buffer
- Draw layer (freehand canvas)
- Text layer
- GPU particle system
- Sequencer buffers ×3 — record and loop any source; variable frame count (4–480 frames)
- SDF raymarching generator — GPU-raymarched metaballs routable as pipeline source; Sphere/Box/Torus shapes; KIFS fractal folding; camera navigation; domain repetition; surface displacement; luma warp; triplanar video texturing; AO + glow; HSV colour; glass refraction + Fresnel; dedicated texSrc/refractSrc routing
- Rutt-Etra Scan Processor — the 1972 scan processor, scanlines deflected by the luminance of any source and viewed through an orbiting perspective camera; drawn as beams or spherically shaded dots with independent widths; depth transfer function (gamma + pivot); asymmetric temporal slew in seconds, so live video becomes a viscous topography rather than jittery spikes; phosphor persistence with spatial bleed; phosphor tint or the source's own colour; full 360° orbit on both axes and free placement; and the raster wraps onto a Plane, Sphere, Cylinder, Torus, Catenoid, Helicoid or Gyroid
- Drag-and-drop to load video/image files

### Effects Chain

- TransferMode — 22 blend modes (Add, Difference, Multiply, Screen, Overlay, etc.)
- Displacement (amount, angle, offset, RotateGrey)
- WarpMap — draw the displacement map directly on the output canvas, or drive the same brush from LFO/MIDI/OSC via WarpDrawX/Y; shared Radius and Strength; 16 slots and 8 procedural shapes recallable from a controller, with timed crossfade between maps
- Luminance keyer (White, Black, Softness)
- Blend / frame persistence / motion blur
- ColorShift
- 3D LUT colour grading (.cube files)
- Interlace
- Fade
- Mirror / Quad mirror
- Kaleidoscope
- Bloom
- Vignette
- Chroma key (colour picker)
- Film grain, scanlines
- Video delay line
- Pixel sort
- Levels correction
- Stroboscope

### Controller Mapping

Right-click any parameter to assign:

- Mouse X/Y
- MIDI CC (with channel filter)
- LFO (Sine/Triangle/Sawtooth/Ramp Down/Square/S&H; BPM sync; beat retrigger)
- Audio FFT (bass / mid / high)
- Audio beat detection + auto-BPM
- Random
- Fixed value
- Key (keyboard trigger)
- Expression (math formula)
- Parameter lock
- Slew/smoothing (configurable lag time)

### Automation & Sequencing

- Automation recorder — record parameter movements, loop playback
- Step sequencer — rhythmic preset recall; configurable pattern
- Preset morph — smooth crossfade between two preset states

### MIDI

- MIDI CC input (per-channel filter)
- MIDI Note input
- MIDI Program Change → preset recall
- MIDI Clock sync (BPM lock)
- MIDI output feedback (motorized faders)

### Output

- Fullscreen (double-click canvas or `Cmd+F`)
- Second monitor — `⊡` opens letterboxed popup on any connected display
- Ghost mode — dims main canvas when second screen is active
- Output resolution — Display / 720p / 1080p / 540p / Quarter
- WebM recording
- Non-realtime frame capture — 📷 pauses render loop; Step Frame / Auto-Run exports numbered PNG sequence

### Project & State Management

- **Project → Bank → State hierarchy** — standard live performance mental model
- **Project files (.imweb)** — `Cmd+S` or Export button downloads the full session
- **Banks** — named groups of States; bank list in the Project tab; bank dropdown in the bottom-right corner
- **States** — unlimited fully self-contained snapshots per Bank (parameter values + FX order + controller assignments + media refs); thumbnail grid in the bottom bar
- **Neutral State** — resets all parameter values without touching controller assignments
- **Bank export/import (.imbank)** — share a single bank
- **State export/import (.imstate)** — share a single state

### AI

- Multi-provider system — Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama (local), OpenRouter; switchable, API keys stored locally
- AI State Generator — LLM-driven parameter patching ("make a slow organic ocean")
- AI shader generation — describe an effect in natural language and the provider writes the GLSL; compile-checked before it reaches the editor, with one automatic repair attempt on compiler errors
- AI Narrator — periodic AI-generated description of the current parameter state, shown as an overlay
- AI Coach — periodic AI-generated performance suggestions
- AI Settings panel — per-provider live model lists, connection status, configurable Narrator/Coach interval & response length

### UI

- Signal path display — hidden by default; ┄ toolbar toggle; float/dock via `Shift+P`
- Live GLSL editor — CodeMirror 6 with GLSL syntax highlighting; built-in and saveable user presets, recallable from MIDI/LFO over a configurable index range; auto-injected VJ uniform contract (audio FFT, previous frame, BPM/beat, level/bass/mid/high); insert routing to Master Output, Foreground, Background or Displace; compile errors fall back to the last good shader instead of dropping the render loop
- First-visit onboarding overlay
- Help menu (status-bar `?`) — guided tour, keyboard shortcuts, the three manuals, About
- Guided tour (`Shift+G`) — 27 steps in three tracks (Basics / Principles / Instruments); it points at controls, it never sets them
- LFO visualiser in context menu
- Vectorscope (Lissajous / waveform / FFT) as source
- Parameter search overlay (`/`)
- Keyboard help overlay (`?`)
- Audio VU meter in status bar
- Projection mapping — CSS homography corner-pin on second screen; calibration grid (`G`); corner nudge (arrow keys)

## Video Preparation

```bash
# Convert raw clips to ImWeb-optimised format (H.264 All-Intra, AAC audio)
node imweb-prep.js
# Drop source files in _raw_videos/, output goes to _imweb_ready/
```

As of v0.14.0 this writes **faststart** MP4s (`-movflags +faststart`), moving the
`moov` atom to the front of the file. Without it a browser cannot report a clip's
duration until it has read to EOF — seconds on a large All-Intra clip, or never
under load.

**Clips prepped before v0.14.0 need a one-off remux.** It is lossless — no
re-encode, no quality change:

```bash
ffmpeg -i old.mp4 -c copy -movflags +faststart new.mp4
```

Still open:

- [ ] Hypercube instancer texture switching (live source change without reset)
- [ ] Performance profiling / GPU display

- [ ] Multi-cam workflow (per-layer camera selector)
- [ ] iPad soak test of the dual-deck engine and the 8-tab bar on real hardware
